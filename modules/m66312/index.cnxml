  <md:title>Tooth Formation</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Teeth start to develop very early during embryonic life. Each tooth develops in its own bud formed by the dental lamina. Ectoderm forms and enamel organ in which ameloblasts for enamel. The ectomesenchyme originates a dental papilla that forms dentin and pulp, and dental follicle which originates the periodontium. Odontoblasts in the pulp secrete the dentin and maintain it through cellular processes that extend into dentinal tubules. The pulp is irrigated by branches of the maxillary and inferior alveolar arteries. It is innervated by sensory fibers of the maxillary and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve. The tooth contains pain receptors and the odontoblasts respond to mechanical and thermal disturbance of the fluid in the dentinal tubules. Roots can complete their development years after the crown. Healthy dental formation requires Ca, P and vitamins A, C and D.</md:abstract>

The closest surrounding  ectomesenchymal cells differentiate forming the dental sac (dental follicle). The enamel organ will eventually produce enamel, the dental papilla will produce dentin and pulp, and the dental sac will produce all the supporting structures of a tooth, the periodontium.</para>

They leave behind a cellular extension called <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontoblast_process"><emphasis effect="underline">odontoblast process</emphasis></link>.

Fibroblasts from the dental follicle secrete collagen and bind it to fibers on the surfaces of adjacent bone and cementum. These attachments develop as the tooth erupts into the mouth.

      <title>Tooth eruption</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1388976176">Tooth eruption is when a tooth ruptures the oral epithelium and becomes visible in the mouth. Osteoclasts erode the bone to create a passage for the tooth follicle, while osteoblasts add alveolar bone to the spaces behind the tooth. Tooth loss is called exfoliation, and it is naturally initiated when a primary tooth is due to be replaced by a permanent one.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1554051104">The mechanism that controls the movement of the tooth during eruption is not yet fully understood. Some ideas that have been disproven over time include that the tooth is pushed upward by: (1) growth of the root; (2) growth of the bone around the tooth; (3) vascular pressure; and (4) a cushioned hammock. The cushioned hammock concept postulated that a <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"><emphasis effect="underline">ligament</emphasis></link> below a tooth was responsible for eruption. Later, the proposed "ligament" was determined to be merely an <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(observational)"><emphasis effect="underline">artifact</emphasis></link> of histological technique. Tooth eruption is currently believed to be based on gradual changes to the attachments of the periodontal ligament.</para>

Once the first permanent tooth erupts into the mouth, the teeth are in the mixed (or transitional) dentition. After the last primary tooth falls out, the teeth are in the permanent dentition.</para>

      <title>Nutrition and tooth development</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm351414544">As in other aspects of human growth and development, nutrition has an effect on the developing tooth. Essential nutrients for a healthy tooth include <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"><emphasis effect="underline">calcium</emphasis></link>, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus"><emphasis effect="underline">phosphorus</emphasis></link>, and <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"><emphasis effect="underline">vitamins</emphasis></link><link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinol"><emphasis effect="underline">A</emphasis></link>, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"><emphasis effect="underline">C</emphasis></link>, and <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"><emphasis effect="underline">D</emphasis></link>. Calcium and phosphorus are needed to properly form the hydroxyapatite crystals, and their levels in the blood are maintained by Vitamin D. Vitamin A is necessary for skin growth (formation of <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin"><emphasis effect="underline">keratin</emphasis></link><emphasis effect="underline">)</emphasis>, and vitamin C for  production of collagen. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1420852896">Fluoride, although not a nutrient, is incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal of a developing tooth and bones. Low levels of fluoride incorporation and fluoride in saliva reduce enamel demineralization and decay. Fluoride ingestion can delay eruption of teeth for as much as a year. This delay has been suggested as the reason for the apparent reduction in decay among the youngest children. Excessive fluoride ingestion during tooth development can lead to a permanent condition known as <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_fluorosis"><emphasis effect="underline">fluorosis</emphasis></link> with varying levels of severity.</para>
