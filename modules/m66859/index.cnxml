  <md:title>The Ears</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Ion channels open when the hair bundle of hair cell is deflected by a mechanical stimulus and this leads the cell to secrete neurotransmitters and stimulate the associated sensory neuron. The mechanical stimulus is therefore transduced into a neural stimulus. This forms the base of the senses of balance and hearing. Mechanoreceptors like hair cells are found in most animals from cnidarians to vertebrates. In mammals, they are found only in the inner ears which are composed of vestibule and cochlea. The vestibule contains three semicircular canals, the saccule and the utricle. These organs detect rotational and linear accelerations of the head. The cochlea contains the organ of Corti which is specialized in detecting sound. Acoustic waves enter the ear by reflecting on the auricle, crossing the ear canal and vibrating the eardrum. The vibration is then transferred from the eardrum to oval window by the malleus, incus and stapes, the smallest bones of the body. The oval window vibrates the fluid inside the inner ear, bringing the signal to the hair cells in the organ of Corti.</md:abstract>

    <para id="import-auto-idm466367968">The ears provide the senses of hearing and balance. Their middle portion is an air-filled cavity that connects to the mouth or nasopharynx. This connection allows for adjustment to changes in atmospheric pressure, it influences hearing and voice and it can allow for infections to spread between the two cavities. The inner portions of the ears are fluid-filled chambers that contain hair cells. These sensory detectors do not regenerate in mammals and exposure to loud noise can produce permanent hearing loss. </para><section id="import-auto-idm453660768">

Such merging would preserve the signal but it would discard the location information. The signal from each region of the organ is transmitted to the brain through separate axons. The brain determines the direction of the movement (or gravity) by identifying the axons that are bringing in the signal.

They are the otolithic organs: saccule, utricle and lagena (missing in mammals). These otolithic organs share the property of containing mineralized bodies called otoliths (oto = ear, lithos = stone). When the head tissues move, the otholiths lag, producing deflection of the hair bundles of neighboring hair cells.

The concretion is called sagitta in the saccule, lapillus in the utricle and asteriscus in the lagena (absent in most mammals). They can reach large sizes (31.4 mm, 11% of the body length), although they remain smaller in most species. The otoliths grow throughout the life of the fish by peripheral deposition of calcium carbonate (mostly aragonite). The growth rate tends to accompany that of the body and vary along the year, resulting in the appearance of rings that resemble <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_rings"><emphasis effect="underline">tree rings</emphasis></link>. By counting the rings, it is possible to determine the age of the fishes from habitats with well-defined growth seasons. After the death and decomposition of a fish, otoliths may be preserved within the body of an organism or be dispersed before burial and <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil"><emphasis effect="underline">fossilization</emphasis></link>.

In amphibians, sound detection is mostly performed by two other vestibular maculae, the amphibian papilla and the basilar papilla. In birds and mammals, the cochlea is the main hearing organ.

The stereocilia of the hair cells extend into the otolithic membrane. The otoliths essentially increase the inertia of the otolithic membrane, which moves separately from the macula in response to head movements. Tilting the head causes the otolithic membrane to slide over the macula in the direction of gravity. The movement of the otolithic membrane, in turn, deflects the sterocilia, causing some hair cells to depolarize as others hyperpolarize. The exact position of the head is interpreted by the brain based on the pattern of hair-cell depolarization.</para>

      <para id="import-auto-idm309111104">A semicircular canal is a ring-like extension of the inner ear. Its enlarged base is called the ampulla. A group of hair cells is found inside the ampulla. They respond to rotational movement, such as turning the head while saying “no.” The stereocilia of these hair cells extend into the cupula, a gelatinous structure that partially obliterates the ampulla. As the head rotates in a plane parallel to the semicircular canal, the fluid lags, deflecting the cupula in the direction opposite to the head movement. The role of the semicircular canal is therefore detecting rotational movement of the head.</para>

Hagfishes (jawless fish) have a single semicircular canal, lampreys have two or three, and all jawed vertebrates have three semicircular canals. By comparing the relative amounts of movement detected by each ampulla, the ear can detect the direction of most head rotations within the three-dimensional (3-D) space.</para>

      <title>Hearing in humans</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm490574688">Hearing, or audition, is the transduction of sound waves into a neural signal that is made possible by the structures of the ear. The large, fleshy structure on the lateral aspect of the head is known as the auricle. Some sources will also refer to this structure as the pinna, though that term is more appropriate for a structure that can be moved, such as the external ear of a cat. The C-shaped curves of the auricle direct sound waves toward the auditory canal. The canal enters the skull through the external auditory meatus of the temporal bone. At the end of the auditory canal is the tympanic membrane, or ear drum, which vibrates after it is struck by sound waves. The auricle, ear canal, and tympanic membrane are often referred to as the external ear. The middle ear consists of a space spanned by three small bones called the ossicles. The three ossicles are the malleus, incus, and stapes, which are Latin names that roughly translate to hammer, anvil, and stirrup. The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane and articulates with the incus. The incus, in turn, articulates with the stapes. The stapes is then attached to the inner ear, where the sound waves will be transduced into a neural signal. The middle ear is connected to the pharynx through the Eustachian tube, which helps equilibrate air pressure across the tympanic membrane. The tube is normally closed but will pop open when the muscles of the pharynx contract during swallowing or yawning.</para>

      <para id="import-auto-idm421639648">The inner ear is often described as a bony labyrinth, as it is composed of a series of canals embedded within the temporal bone. It has two separate regions, the cochlea and the vestibule, which are responsible for hearing and balance, respectively. The neural signals from these two regions are relayed to the brain stem through separate fiber bundles. However, these two distinct bundles travel together from the inner ear to the brain stem as the vestibulocochlear nerve. Sound is transduced into neural signals within the cochlear region of the inner ear, which contains the sensory neurons of the spiral ganglia. These ganglia are located within the spiral-shaped cochlea of the inner ear. The cochlea is attached to the stapes through the oval window.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm756268288">The oval window is located at the beginning of a fluid-filled tube within the cochlea called the scala vestibuli.

At the uppermost tip of the cochlea, the scala vestibuli curves over the top of the cochlear duct. The fluid-filled tube, now called the scala tympani, returns to the base of the cochlea, this time traveling under the cochlear duct. The scala tympani ends at the round window, which is covered by a membrane that contains the fluid within the scala. As vibrations of the ossicles travel through the oval window, the fluid of the scala vestibuli and scala tympani moves in a wave-like motion. The frequency of the fluid waves match the frequencies of the sound waves. The membrane covering the round window will bulge out or pucker in with the movement of the fluid within the scala tympani.</para>

As the fluid waves move through the scala vestibuli and scala tympani, the basilar membrane moves at a specific spot, depending on the frequency of the waves. Higher frequency waves move the region of the basilar membrane that is close to the base of the cochlea. Lower frequency waves move the region of the basilar membrane that is near the tip of the cochlea.</para>

      <para id="import-auto-idm436671536">The organs of Corti contain hair cells, which are named for the hair-like stereocilia extending from the cell’s apical surfaces. The stereocilia are an array of microvilli-like structures arranged from tallest to shortest. Protein fibers tether adjacent hairs together within each array, such that the array will bend in response to movements of the basilar membrane. The stereocilia extend up from the hair cells to the overlying tectorial membrane, which is attached medially to the organ of Corti. When the pressure waves from the scala move the basilar membrane, the tectorial membrane slides across the stereocilia. This bends the stereocilia either toward or away from the tallest member of each array. When the stereocilia bend toward the tallest member of their array, tension in the protein tethers opens ion channels in the hair cell membrane. This will depolarize the hair cell membrane, triggering nerve impulses that travel down the afferent nerve fibers attached to the hair cells. When the stereocilia bend toward the shortest member of their array, the tension on the tethers slackens and the ion channels close. When no sound is present, and the stereocilia are standing straight, a small amount of tension still exists on the tethers, keeping the membrane potential of the hair cell slightly depolarized.</para>

The stereocilia are tethered together by proteins that open ion channels when the array is bent toward the tallest member of their array, and closed when the array is bent toward the shortest member of their array.</para>

      <caption>Human cochlea and organ of Corti under light microscope with a magnification of 412 x . <link url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/1427_Cochlea_Micrograph.jpg">More details</link>.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-idm414181952">As stated above, a given region of the basilar membrane will only move if the incoming sound is at a specific frequency. Because the tectorial membrane only moves where the basilar membrane moves, the hair cells in this region will also only respond to sounds of this specific frequency. Therefore, as the frequency of a sound changes, different hair cells are activated all along the basilar membrane. The cochlea encodes auditory stimuli for frequencies between 20 and 20,000 Hz, which is the range of sound that human ears can detect. The unit of Hertz measures the frequency of sound waves in terms of cycles produced per second. Frequencies as low as 20 Hz are detected by hair cells at the apex, or tip, of the cochlea. Frequencies in the higher ranges of 20 KHz are encoded by hair cells at the base of the cochlea, close to the round and oval windows. Most auditory stimuli contain a mixture of sounds at a variety of frequencies and intensities (represented by the amplitude of the sound wave). The hair cells along the length of the cochlear duct, which are each sensitive to a particular frequency, allow the cochlea to separate auditory stimuli by frequency, just as a prism separates visible light into its component colors.</para>

      <caption>Frequency coding in the cochlea. <link url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/1408_Frequency_Coding_in_The_Cochlea.jpg">More details</link>.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-idm251918288">The standing sound wave generated in the cochlea by the movement of the oval window deflects the basilar membrane on the basis of the frequency of sound. Therefore, hair cells at the base of the cochlea are activated only by high frequencies, whereas those at the apex of the cochlea are activated only by low frequencies.</para>
