  <md:title>Homodont animals</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Homodont animals have all teeth of a same type. A great diversity of tooth structures is found among species, however. Diet and feeding habit are the main driving forces shaping the evolution of teeth. Specializations are found for cutting meet, seizing prey, crushing seeds, dealing with abrasion by grass, and injecting venom.</md:abstract>

      <title>Tooth types</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm356431600">Most toothed vertebrates exhibit repetitions of a single type of tooth (homodont) that varies in size across the dentition. Diet and feeding habit can cause natural selection to gradually mold tooth shape producing remarkably specialized teeth. Carnivory in fishes favors the evolution of flat teeth with a sharp edges for cutting meat. They tend to be triangular with a pointy tip to facilitate penetration. Piranhas are South American freshwater fish with carnivorous habit. They are famous for having very sharp teeth and quickly aggregating and dismantling large animals at the first sign of blood in the water.</para>

A serrated cutting edge has many small points of contact with the material being cut. By having less <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_area"><emphasis effect="underline">contact area</emphasis></link> than a smooth blade or other edge, the applied pressure at each point of contact is greater and the points of contact are at a sharper angle to the material being cut. The tooth produces many small splits in the surface of the material being cut and merges them as it moves.</para>

In addition to the tiny denticles found along the jaws, some frogs have vomerine teeth, found on the roof of the mouth.

Most lizards and crocodilians have large numbers of conical teeth designed to perforate and retain live food items. They mostly ingest their prey whole as opposed to biting pieces off such as carnivore fishes with blade-like teeth do.

Their teeth also vary in the presence and position of groves on the teeth, which serve the role of transporting venom from the base to the tip of the tooth. Most snakes can be placed into one of four groups, based on their teeth, and this grouping correlates strongly with lineage and venom type. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm907122752">Aglyphous (lacking groves) snakes have no specialized teeth. All teeth are similar in shape and often size. Most aglyphous snakes, including boas and pythons are non-venomous. Some are considered mildly venomous, but they are generally not harmful to humans.</para>
