  <md:title>Vocal Systems</md:title>
  <md:abstract>The human larynx is protects the entrance of the trachea and produces voice. It is structured by three large unpaired cartilages (thyroid, cricoid and epiglottis) and three paired cartilages (arytenoid, corniculate and cuneiform). Internally it contains a pair of true vocal folds and a second, more superior pair false vocal folds with protective role. The intrinsic laryngeal muscles control the abduction of the vocal folds for respiration and adduction for voice or for protection during swallowing. These muscles are innervated by the superior and recurrent laryngeal nerves, which are branches of the vagus nerve (CN X). The vocal folds are formed by cover of mucus, epithelium and connective tissue, a vocal ligament rich in elastin and collagen and a body formed by the thyroarytenoid muscle.</md:abstract>

      <title>The Human Larynx</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1088892352">The larynx is a cartilaginous structure inferior to the laryngopharynx that connects the pharynx to the trachea and helps regulate the volume of air that enters and leaves the lungs. The structure of the larynx is formed by several pieces of cartilage. Three large cartilage pieces—the thyroid cartilage (anterior), epiglottis (superior), and cricoid cartilage (inferior)—form the major structure of the larynx. The thyroid cartilage is the largest piece of cartilage that makes up the larynx. The thyroid cartilage consists of the laryngeal prominence, or “Adam’s apple,” which tends to be more prominent in males. The thick cricoid cartilage forms a ring, with a wide posterior region and a thinner anterior region. Three smaller, paired cartilages—the arytenoids, corniculates, and cuneiforms—attach to the epiglottis and the vocal cords and muscle that help move the vocal cords to produce speech.</para>

When in the “closed” position, the unattached end of the epiglottis rests on the glottis. The glottis is composed of the vestibular folds, the true vocal cords, and the space between these folds. A vestibular fold, or false vocal cord, is one of a pair of folded sections of mucous membrane. A true vocal cord is one of the white, membranous folds attached by muscle to the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages of the larynx on their outer edges. The inner edges of the true vocal cords are free, allowing oscillation to produce sound. The size of the membranous folds of the true vocal cords differs between individuals, producing voices with different pitch ranges. Folds in males tend to be larger than those in females, which create a deeper voice. The act of swallowing causes the pharynx and larynx to lift upward, allowing the pharynx to expand and the epiglottis of the larynx to swing downward, closing the opening to the trachea. These movements produce a larger area for food to pass through, while preventing food and beverages from entering the trachea.</para>
