  <md:title>Diversity of Jaw Movements</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Vertebrates with jaws can bite, and their feeding effectiveness is greatly increased by suction. Lateral expansion of the operculum and lowering of the mouth floor provide such suction, whereas projection of the jaws accelererates the containment of prey. Both mechanisms promoted the increase in number of articulations between cranial and facial bones. Across vertebrates, the need for ingestion of large pray items whole has promoted cranial kinesis, whereas the need for strong biting has promoted bone fusion. Mammals seem to have lost their skull kinesis in favor of improved suckling through the evolution of a hard palate.</md:abstract>

    <para id="import-auto-idm785479808">The evolution of jaws was a big event among fishes. It permitted biting and it provided structural support for the buccal pump. Jawed fishes could maintain a high rate of water flow through their gills using the buccal pump. This would keep the blood well oxigenated even if the fish was not actively swimming. The buccal pump made possible another important advancement, however: suction feeding!</para>

      <title>Suction feeding</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm398554544">This is a method of ingestion in which the food item enters the mouth of the organism carried by a volume of medium that is sucked in. It is typically accomplished by the predator expanding the volume of its oral cavity and/or throat, resulting in a pressure difference between the inside of the mouth and the outside environment. When the mouth is opened, the pressure difference causes water to flow into the predator's mouth, carrying the prey in with the flow.</para>

This feeding mechanism is enhanced by simultaneous fast upper jaw protrusion, which directs the suction and accelerates the containment of the prey. <link url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbDufIMd_T8">Watch this video</link> on suction feeding by the WainwrightLab at the University of California, Davis. </para>

Instead of sucking in the water with food, in ram feeding the fish swims forward with the mouth and the gill slits open. Water flows through the mouth and exits through the gills, while food items are retained in the mouth and directed to the esophagus. Many fishes are not restricted to suction or ram feeding but alternate between these methods or employ a combination of them, adding some suction to the forward motion of the body when an  item of interest is detected.  </para>

As the group diversified using suction feeding a general trend arose of liberating more and more bony elements to allow greater skull motility. A common arrangement in ray-finned fishes is a four component kinetic system. The hyoid is linked to the mandible by ligaments and moves together with it. The hyoid articulates with the ceratohyal bone which articulates with the suspensorial bone. In a four-part movement that also involves the cranium and shoulder girdle, the lower jaw can be extensively protracted. The width of the mouth can also be greatly expanded, producing the water inflow that is necessary for suction feeding.</para>

Opposite to the common perception that birdâ€™s beaks are completely rigid, cranial kinesis in birds has been categorized in three different classes. These articulations allow shore birds to probe the mud with their beaks and curve the tips, to use them like forceps. Other birds can curve the beak to increase the height or the width of the passage, increasing the range of food item sizes that they can swallow.</para>
