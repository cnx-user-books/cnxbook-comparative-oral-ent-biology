  <md:title>Dental Restoration</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Dental restoration involves tooth preparation and filling. The preparation is mostly influenced by the extent of decay and the structural state of the tooth. All decayed tissues and healthy tissues without structural support are removed. Many options are available for filling materials and procedures. Direct restorations are produced in the tooth, whereas indirect restorations are produced in the lab and cemented onto the tooth. Considerations in the choice of materials and techniques include durability, cost, appearance, position, size of the cavity and type of tooth (deciduous or permanent). Composite resin and amalgam are most common in direct fillings whereas gold and ceramic are most common in crowns.</md:abstract>

    <para id="import-auto-idm883187776">A dental restoration or dental filling is a treatment to restore the function, integrity, and morphology of missing tooth structure resulting from <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries">caries</link> or external trauma. A restoration can be direct and indirect  and it is classified by location and size. A <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_canal_therapy">root canal filling</link>, for example, is a restorative technique used to fill the space where the <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_pulp">dental pulp</link> normally resides.</para>

The white outer <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel">enamel</link> appears intact, while the yellow, underlying <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin">dentin</link> appears recessed. This is because a large amount of decayed dentin was removed. This portion of the enamel is now unsupported, and should be removed to prevent future fracture. <link url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Undermined4.jpg">More details</link>.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-idm353555888">Restoring a tooth to good form and function requires two steps: (1) preparing the tooth for placement of restorative material or materials, and (2) placement of these materials. The process of preparation usually involves removing the decayed material from the tooth with a rotary dental handpiece and dental <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr_(cutter)">burrs</link>. If permanent restoration cannot be carried out immediately after tooth preparation, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_restoration">temporary restoration</link> may be performed.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm912866752">A number of considerations will determine the type and extent of the preparation. The most important factor to consider is <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries">decay</link>. The extent of the decay greatly influences the extent of the preparation, and in turn, the subsequent method and appropriate materials for restoration. Another consideration is unsupported tooth structure. When preparing the tooth to receive a restoration, unsupported enamel is removed to allow for a more predictable restoration. While enamel is the hardest substance in the human body, it is particularly brittle, and unsupported enamel fractures easily.</para>

      <title>Direct restorations</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm916074336">This technique involves placing a soft or malleable filling into the prepared tooth and building up the tooth. The materials used are most commonly  <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_materials#Gold">gold</link>, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalgam_(dentistry)">amalgam</link>, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_composite">dental composites</link>, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_ionomer_cement">glass ionomer cement</link>, or <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_porcelain">porcelain</link>. The material is then set hard and the tooth is restored. The advantage of direct restorations is that they usually set quickly and can be placed in a single procedure. The decision of which material to use is usually made based on the location and severity of the cavity.</para>

      <title>Indirect restorations</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1113237280">In this technique the restoration is fabricated outside of the mouth using <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_impressions">dental impressions</link> of the prepared tooth.

Usually a <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_technician">dental technician</link> fabricates the indirect restoration from records the dentist has provided. The most commonly used materials are gold and ceramics. The finished restoration is bonded permanently with a <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_cement">dental cement</link>. The treatment is often done in at least two separate visits to the dentist because time is needed for the fabrication of the restoration after the impression is obtained. While the indirect restoration is being prepared, a <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_restoration">temporary restoration</link> is used to cover the prepared tooth and allow the patient to bite. This usually consists of a softer dental cement that can easily be removed with the dental drill.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1167106768">Removable dental prostheses (mainly <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures">dentures</link>) are a form of indirect dental restoration, as they are made to replace missing teeth. There are numerous types of precision attachments (also known as combined restorations) to aid removable prosthetic attachment to teeth, including magnets, clips, hooks, and implants which may themselves be seen as a form of dental restoration.</para>

        <title>Composite resin</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1026120512">Dental composites, also called "white fillings", are a group of restorative materials used in dentistry. In addition to fillings done at the clinic, composite resins are also used to manufacture crowns and in-lays in the laboratory. The greatest advantage of these materials is that they can be made tooth-colored. Their strength and durability is not as high as porcelain or metal restorations and they are more prone to wear and discoloration. Compositions vary widely, with proprietary mixes of resins forming the matrix, as well as engineered filler glasses and glass ceramics. </para>

This process is quick and safe, but it require the  composites to be applied in thin layers as determined by their opacity. Immediately after light induced curing, the final surface can be be shaped and polished.</para>

        <title>Glass ionomer cement</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm371959728">A <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_ionomer_cement">glass ionomer cement</link> (GIC) is one of a class of materials commonly used in dentistry as filling materials and <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luting">luting</link> cements. These materials are based on the reaction of silicate glass powder and polyalkenoic acid. These materials can also have the color of the tooth and they were used to  restore anterior teeth before composite resins were developed.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm371956896">As they bond chemically to dental hard tissues and release fluoride for a relatively long period, modern-day applications of GICs have expanded. The desirable properties of glass ionomer cements make them useful in restorations at  low-stress areas on primary teeth. They do not need to be applied layer by layer, like in composite fillings.</para>

They are also used as in-lays, on-lays, and aesthetic <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcelain_veneers">veneers</link>. A veneer is a very thin shell of porcelain that can replace or cover part of the enamel of the tooth. Full-porcelain restorations are particularly desirable because their color and translucency mimic natural tooth enamel. Porcelain can be combined with metal to provide strength to a crown or bridge. These restorations are more durable than porcelain used alone.</para>

This significantly increases the risk of the tooth fracturing in the future when excess force is placed on the tooth, such as trauma or grinding teeth at night. The standard treatment of large cavities and root canal therapy in premolars and molar includes sealing with a crown because this reduces the risk of fracture.</para>
