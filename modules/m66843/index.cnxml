  <md:title>Mechanisms of Deglutition</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Swallowing is the transport of food from the mouth into the stomach. The general mechanism is peristalsis of the digestive tube, but fishes can help it using mucociliary transport or pharyngeals jaws. Frogs add a muscular tongue and retraction of the eyes and some birds use gravity. Mammals have a palate and a muscular soft palate that protects the nasal cavity from the entrance of food. The epiglottis prevents food from entering the larynx. Its effectiveness is reduced in adult humans, however, because our larynx is permanently descended  and the epiglottis does not contact the soft palate. Imperfect swallowing results in chocking or pulmonary aspiration. The human larynx has most likely descended in response to selection for loud and low pitched voice. In newborns, the larynx is not yet descended however and they suckle by producing negative pressures in the mouth to extract milk from the nipple.</md:abstract>

      <para id="import-auto-idm433051840">Vertebrates have incorporated a variety of mechanisms to facilitate the transport of food from the mouth into the esophagus. Several groups make use of multiple mechanisms simultaneously.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm266957024">Fishes use the water flow produced by ram ventilation or the buccal pump to bring food into the mouth. The flowing water exits through the gill openings and does not enter the esophagus. Food items in the mouth are moved into the esophagus by contractions of the pharyngeal musculature and movement of the pharyngeal jaws, when present.</para>

Touch receptors in the oral mucosa stimulate the beating of the cilia when a particle contacts the epithelium. The entire lining of the mouth therefore works as a conveying belt transporting food into the esophagus. Frogs can transport and entire cricket from the mouth into the esophagus through mucociliary transport alone.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm276858112">Many frogs have relatively large eyes that protrude on the surface of the head and can be retracted for protection. When the eyeballs are retracted into the think skull, however, they intrude into the roof of the mouth, forming a convexity that reduces the free internal volume of the mouth. The animals actively use this to facilitate food transport into the esophagus. When a frog swallows, it both  retracts its eyeballs and contracts the floor of the mouth to push the food contained in the mouth posteriorly.</para>

Although this sounds quick and effortless, deglutition is, in fact, a complex process that involves both the skeletal muscle of the tongue and the muscles of the pharynx and esophagus. It is aided by the presence of mucus and saliva. Swallowing consists of three phases: an oral, pharyngeal and esophageal phase. It involves many  smooth muscles of the pharynx and <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus">esophagus</link>.

The tongue propels the bolus posteriorly into the pharynx. The superior longitudinal muscle elevates the apex of the tongue to make contact with the hard palate and the bolus is propelled to the posterior portion of the oral cavity. Once the bolus contacts the palatoglossal arch of the oropharynx, it triggers the pharyngeal phase, which is involuntary. Touch receptors initiating this reflex are scattered over the base of the tongue, the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches, the tonsillar fossa, uvula and posterior pharyngeal wall.</para>

      <title>The descent of the larynx</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm492741536">Swallowing in humans is a rather complicate process and it frequently fails, causing chocking or aspiration of fluids into the lungs. It makes one wonder why do the digestive and respiratory systems have to share the oropharynx? And why do we not see dogs, cats or horses choking when they drink water?</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm778709792">It turns out that while the mechanism of swallowing described above is common to vertebrates, the anatomy of the pharynx is modified in humans. Our unique feature is having a descended larynx in which the epiglottis does not contact the soft palate. The entire oropharynx fits into the gap between the epiglottis and the soft palate in humans.</para>

Our newborns start with the general mammal condition but the larynx descends rapidly as the baby grows. In men, the increase in male sex hormones that takes place during puberty causes the larynx to become larger and descend further than in women.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm504815952">The descended larynx has other effects in addition to making swallowing more challenging. The low position of the larynx renders the trachea shorter and the pharynx longer. The shorter trachea tends to facilitate vocalization by reducing the attenuation and delay that the duct imposes to air pressure changes that are generated at the lungs and are converted into voice at the larynx. A larger pharynx allows for more cavity resonance, emphasis in lower frequencies of voice and potentially a wider range of resonance patterns. This translates into louder and lower pitched voice with a potentially greater variety of producible vowels.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm481146960">Vocal communication is extremely elaborate in humans. The advantages that the descended larynx confer for vocal communication may have generated the selective forces that drove the descent of the larynx. Other vocal primates also benefit from a lowered larynx but they only lower it during vocalization, whereas we have the larynx permanently lowered and have to elevate it to swallow. The physical association between loud and deep voice with large body size and the common involvement of men in territorial disputes may explain the enlargement and increased descent in the male human larynx at sexual maturation.  </para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm722169920">The lack of laryngeal descent in human newborns could be a reflection of special mechanical needs for nursing or of different selective pressure on vocal communication at that age. The fact that milk can flow around the open epiglottis and into the esophagus without entering the larynx raised the question of simultaneous drinking and breathing during nursing in newborns. Again, modern assessments have found evidence of rhythmic patterns of alternation between respiration and swallowing in newborns of humans and other mammals.</para>

      <title>Suckling</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm514091920">Nursing in newborns was a major innovation in vertebrates and promoted the diversification of mammals into an entire class of organisms. Nursing allows females to give birth to small offspring and then continue to transfer nutrients to them until they can forage on their own.

The need for effective nursing is likely to have been the selective force that drove the evolution of the palate in mammals. The mandible, the anterior and posterior portions of the tongue, the lips, the buccinator and other muscles of the mouth move in complex rhythmic coordination during suckling. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm502304256">There has been a long debate about the basic mechanism of suckling, as completely opposite processes seemed plausible. In one hand, milk could be squeezed out of the teat by compression between the tongue and the palate. On the other hand, milk could be extracted out of the teeth by suction produced mainly through lowering of the tongue. Detailed analyzes of live ultrasound imaging during nursing revealed that the tip of the teat retracts when the mandible and tongue are elevated and it protracts when the mandible and tongue are depressed. This conforms with the expectations for milk extraction by suction when the volume of the mouth is increased but not with the expectation for compression when the mandible and tongue are elevated.</para>
