  <md:title>The Oral Cavity</md:title>
  <md:abstract>The oral cavity is formed by the vestibule and the oral cavity proper. The vestibule is delimited by the teeth, lips and cheeks. The oral cavity proper is delimited by the teeth, fauces, roof and floor of the mouth. The oral cavity is lined with oral mucosa, which can be keratinized or nonkeratinized and contains mucous and salivary glands.</md:abstract>

At the entrance to the mouth are the lips, or labia (singular = labium). Their outer covering is skin, which transitions to a mucous membrane in the mouth proper. The lips cover the orbicularis oris muscle, which regulates what comes in and goes out of the mouth. The labial frenulum is a midline fold of mucous membrane that attaches the inner surface of each lip to the gum. </para>

      <caption>Vestibule and oral cavity proper in a human. <link url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Mouth_illustration-Otis_Archives.jpg">More details</link>.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-idm326866160">Cheeks are muscular in humans and cover the teeth, forming the lateral aspect of the face. The inside of the cheek is lined with a <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"><emphasis effect="underline">mucous membrane</emphasis></link> (buccal mucosa) which is part of the <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"><emphasis effect="underline">oral mucosa</emphasis></link>. During <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"><emphasis effect="underline">mastication</emphasis></link> (chewing), the cheeks and tongue between them keep the food between the teeth.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1205454656">The cheeks are covered externally by hairy skin, and internally by the mucous membrane. This membrane is comprised by a sheet of  <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_squamous_epithelium"><emphasis effect="underline">stratified squamous epithelium</emphasis></link> and a sheet of areolar connective tissue. The epithelium is mostly smooth, but may have caudally directed papillae (for example, in <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant"><emphasis effect="underline">ruminants</emphasis></link>). The mucosa is supplied with mucous or salivary secretions from the buccal glands located between the mucous membrane and the buccinator muscle. In carnivores, a superior buccal gland is large and conspicous. It is called the zygomatic gland, because it is found above the zygomatic arch. Between the skin and mucous membranes are connective tissue and buccinator muscles. During chewing, food that gets crushed by premolars and molars tends to fall on the tongue or into the vestibule. Contraction of the buccinator muscle pushes the cheeks against the teeth. This helps to direct food that would fall into the vestibule back in between the teeth for further reduction of particle size. The buccinator muscle may also help in suckling by babies.</para>

      <para id="import-auto-idm1231498720">The part of the oral cavity (mouth) that is not the vestibule is called the oral cavity proper. It is delimited by the teeth, the pharynx, the roof of the mouth and the tongue, or floor of the mouth.</para>

The anterior region of the palate serves as a wall (or septum) between the oral and nasal cavities as well as a rigid shelf against which the tongue can push food. It is created by the maxillary and palatine bones of the skull and, given its bony structure, is known as the hard palate. If you run your tongue along the roof of your mouth, youâ€™ll notice that the hard palate ends in the posterior oral cavity, and the tissue becomes fleshier. This part of the palate, known as the soft palate, is composed mainly of skeletal muscle. We move the soft palate subconciously to yawn, swallow, or sing. During swallowing, contraction of two muscles that attached to the soft palate move it upward to close the passage into the nasal cavity and direct the food into the oropharynx.</para>

It has been suggested that the uvula is a vestigial organ, but it may have a role in preventing unintended early swallowing of items in the mouth during chewing. The space between the uvula and the base of the tongue is the fauces and it marks the limit between the oral cavity and the pharynx. Two muscular folds extend downward from the soft palate, on either side of the uvula. Anteriorly, the palatoglossal arch lies next to the base of the tongue. Posterior to it, the palatopharyngeal arch forms the superior and lateral margins of the fauces. Between these two arches are the palatine tonsils. These are clusters of lymphoid tissue that protect the pharynx from pathogens. The lingual tonsils are located at the base of the tongue.</para>
