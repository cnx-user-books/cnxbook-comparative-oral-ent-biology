  <md:title>The Olfactory System</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Olfactory receptor cells are found in the olfactory epithelium located on the roof of the nasal cavity. When stimulated by odorants, these cells produce action potentials which travel down the axon through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone and into the brain. Olfactory information is processed in various parts of the brain, but mostly in the olfactory cortex of the cerebrum. The sense of olfaction tends to be well developed in nocturnal animals and least developed in visually-oriented diurnal animals such as most birds. This sense is used for food detection and analysis, and species and individual recognition such as in territoriality, mate attraction and kin recognition.</md:abstract>

      <title>Structure</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm346736704">The sense of smell, or olfaction, is responsive to chemical stimuli. The olfactory receptor neurons are located in a small region within the superior nasal cavity. This region is referred to as the olfactory epithelium and contains bipolar sensory neurons. Each olfactory sensory neuron has dendrites that extend from the apical surface of the epithelium into the mucus lining the cavity. As airborne molecules are inhaled through the nose, they pass over the olfactory epithelial region and dissolve into the mucus. These odorant molecules bind to proteins that keep them dissolved in the mucus and help transport them to the olfactory dendrites. The odorant–protein complex binds to a receptor protein within the cell membrane of an olfactory dendrite. These receptors are G protein–coupled, and will produce a graded membrane potential in the olfactory neurons.</para>

      <caption>The olfactory epithelium in humans. <link url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/1403_Olfaction.jpg">More details</link>.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-idm1747014016">The axon of an olfactory neuron extends from the basal surface of the epithelium, through an olfactory foramen in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and into the brain. The group of axons called the olfactory tract connect to the olfactory bulb on the ventral surface of the frontal lobe. From there, the axons split to travel to several brain regions. Some travel to the cerebrum, specifically to the primary olfactory cortex that is located in the inferior and medial areas of the temporal lobe. Others project to structures within the limbic system and hypothalamus, where smells become associated with long-term memory and emotional responses. This is how certain smells trigger emotional memories, such as the smell of food associated with one’s birthplace. Smell is the one sensory modality that does not synapse in the thalamus before connecting to the cerebral cortex. This intimate connection between the olfactory system and the cerebral cortex is one reason why smell can be a potent trigger of memories and emotion.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1040127968">The nasal epithelium, including the olfactory cells, can be harmed by airborne toxic chemicals. Therefore, the olfactory neurons are regularly replaced within the nasal epithelium, after which the axons of the new neurons must find their appropriate connections in the olfactory bulb. These new axons grow along the axons that are already in place in the cranial nerve.</para>

      <para id="import-auto-idm327243072">Based on experiments in which animals animals are exposed to aromas in known extreme dilutions, dogs are estimated to have an olfactory sense approximately ten thousand to a hundred thousand times more acute than a human's. <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodhound"><emphasis effect="underline">Bloodhounds</emphasis></link> were bred for the  purpose of tracking humans and they can detect a <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scent_trail"><emphasis effect="underline">scent trail</emphasis></link> a few days old. <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear"><emphasis effect="underline">Bears</emphasis></link> are also highly sensitive, and this is essential for locating food underground. Using their elongated claws, bears dig deep trenches in search of burrowing animals and nests as well as roots, bulbs, and insects. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1147923712">Fishes have a well-developed sense of smell. Salmon utilize their sense of smell to identify and return to their home stream waters. Catfish use their sense of smell to identify other individual catfish and to maintain a social hierarchy. Many fishes use the sense of smell to identify mating partners or to alert to the presence of food.</para>

In many species, olfaction is highly tuned to <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheromone"><emphasis effect="underline">pheromones</emphasis></link>. Comparisons between species of mammals have revealed some correlation between the size of the nasal cavity, the elaboration of the ethmoturbinates, the area lined with olfactory epithelium and the olfactory sensitivity of the animal. There are many exceptions to this pattern, however, and few species have been studied in detail.</para>

        <title>Food Detection and analysis</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1750711344">Animals vary greatly in diet, method of foraging (searching for food) and sensory abilities. Some foods are more easily detected through olfaction, while others might be easier to find visually. For example, ripe cherries may be located visually by a diurnal animal whereas the nectar of a flower that opens at night may be better detected through olfactory cues.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1217406640">The evaluation of olfactory sensitivity for food detection should not be restricted to the ability of detecting odorants at low concentration. It can be equally important to quantify the number of odorants to which a species is sensitive and its ability to discriminate between the combinations of odors that emanate from various sources.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1098565360">In addition to simply locating a source of food, it is frequently important to analyze its quality before ingesting it. Many plants keep fruits protected by high levels of indigest alkaloids until the fruits are ripe and the seeds ready for dispersal. Other resources such as ripe sweet fruits falling from a tree or a recently killed prey may decompose quickly and it may be important for an opportunistic consumer to evaluate, before consumption, if the nutrient gain will be worth the associated load of toxins.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm974899984">Territorial scent marking may involve behaviors specific to this activity. When <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_wolf#Olfactory"><emphasis effect="underline">a wolf marks its territory</emphasis></link>, it lifts a hind leg and urinates on a scent post (usually an elevated position like a tree, rock, or bush).

        <title>Mate attraction</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm980688848">Many vertebrates use chemical signals (pheromones) to attract mates. Pheromones are  chemical substances released in the urine or feces of animals or secreted from <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_gland"><emphasis effect="underline">sweat glands</emphasis></link> that are perceived by the <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_system"><emphasis effect="underline">olfactory system</emphasis></link> and that elicit both behavioral and <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"><emphasis effect="underline">endocrine</emphasis></link> responses in <link url="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conspecific"><emphasis effect="underline">conspecifics</emphasis></link>. Sex pheromones are used to arouse, attract, and elicit specific behavioral responses from the opposite sex. In mammals, chemical signals and the <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scent_gland"><emphasis effect="underline">scent glands</emphasis></link> that secrete them are frequently found only in adults of one sex, are often only secreted during the breeding season and are used exclusively in mating.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm331508976">Mammalian pheromones can elicit both long-lasting effects that alter the hormone levels of the recipient animal, and short-term effects on its behavior. For example, detection of male pheromones by female mice has been found to encourage onset of <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"><emphasis effect="underline">puberty</emphasis></link>, however the detection of female pheromones have been found to delay the onset of puberty.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1003457872">There is vast evidence for the use of pheromones in mating behaviors. For example, when boars become sexually aroused, they salivate profusely dispersing pheromones into the air. These pheromones attract receptive sows, causing them to adopt a specific mating posture known as standing, which allows the male boar to mount and copulate.</para>

An organism usually contains many loci with MHC genes and there are many alleles of the gene. In addition to its role in immune function, studies suggest that the MHC is also involved in mate choice for many vertebrates through olfactory cues. Several studies have detected odor-based mate choice in rats and other mammals resulting in the selection of mates with different MHC background than the individual making the selection. These mating preferences could be adaptive and  maintain the enormous allelic diversity of the MHC complex.</para>

        <title>Individual or kin recognition</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1232206800">Social cooperation is frequently mediated by cue-based and context-based mechanisms, such as familiarity, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprinting_(psychology)"><emphasis effect="underline">imprinting</emphasis></link> and phenotype matching.
