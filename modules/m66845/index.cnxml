  <md:title>The Biology of the Tonsils</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Tonsils are lymphatic nodules that form the first immunological defense of the digestive tube, at the pharynx. There are pharyngeal, tubal, lingual and palatine tonsils. They have tonsillar crypts that facilitate the entrance of antigens and pathogens deep into the tonsil, where they are processed and destroyed. During respiratory infections, tonsils can become swollen or inflamed. When the palatine tonsils become severely swollen they can hinder swallowing or even breathing. The situation can usually be controlled with medication but when infections are frequent, the palatine tonsils may be surgically removed.</md:abstract>

Similarly the lingual tonsil is frequently considered as a group because it consists of a number of little prominences (rounded masses). This can be confusing, but it reflects differences in wording, rather than differences in biological structure.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm172115808">Like other lymphoid nodules, tonsils are not enclosed in a complete fibrous capsule. The epithelium of the pharynx invaginates deeply into the tonsil to form tonsillar crypts. These structures, which accumulate all sorts of materials taken into the body through eating and breathing, actually “encourage” pathogens to penetrate deep into the tonsillar tissues where they are acted upon by numerous white blood cells and eliminated. </para>

These M cells then alert the underlying B and T lymphocytes in the tonsil that a pathogen is present and an immune response is stimulated. B cells are activated and proliferate in areas called germinal centers in the tonsil. These germinal centers are places where B memory cells are created and antibodies are  produced.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm165554848">This seems to be the major function of tonsils—to help children’s bodies recognize, destroy, and develop immunity to common environmental pathogens so that they will be protected in their later lives. Tonsils tend to reach their largest size near <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty">puberty</link>, and they gradually undergo <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy">atrophy</link> thereafter. However, they are largest relative to the diameter of the throat in young children.</para>

Tonsilitis involving palatine tonsils is dangerous because the  swelling may interfere with breathing and/or swallowing. Tonsillectomy, the surgical removal of the palatine tonsils was common in the past. The development of modern drugs has greatly reduced the need for such removal, but it is still conducted in children who frequently develop throat infections with swelling of the tonsils. </para>
