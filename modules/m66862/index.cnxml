  <md:title>Vowels and Consonants</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Articulatory phonetics is the branch of linguistics that studies how the vocal apparatus is moved to produce speech sounds. The International Phonetic Alphabet is used to represent all the sounds produced in all languages. Vocal sounds are produced as vowels, with unrestricted air flow, or consonants, with blocked or constricted airflow. Vowels are characterized not by fundamental frequency of vocal fold vibration, but by distribution of energy in their harmonics. This is a function of the resonance patterns in the vocal cavities, which can be modified by moving the anatomy of the vocal tract. Vowels are not categorically different in production mode or sound. The categorization is learned and the boundaries are variable among languages, dialects and accents. The articulation of vowels mostly involves raising, protracting or retracting the tongue. Consonants involve blocking or restricting the airflow through various manners of articulation and doing so at various places of articulation. The various possible combinations between manners and places of articulation originate the great variety of consonant sound observed in the multitude of languages spoken around the world.</md:abstract>

      <para id="import-auto-idm757533728">Most of the sounds that humans use in speech are produced by the vocal folds. Non-vocal sounds include clicks produced with the lips or tongue. Vibration of the vocal folds produces complex sound waves with elaborate harmonic structure. The vocal folds can be stretched or relaxed, producing voice over a wide range of fundamental frequencies.</para>

After being produced at the vocal folds, sound is modified through cavity resonances in the pharynx, mouth and nasal cavity and through constriction or interruption of the flow at the soft palate, tongue, teeth or lips. A large number of muscles can move body parts in ways that alter the quality of voice and in this way become part of the vocal system. The vocal system could be the most complex and versatile motor system in our body.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1212484160">Phonetics is the branch of linguistics that studies the sounds of human speech and equivalent aspects of sign languages. It is divided into articulatory, acoustic and auditory phonetics. Articulatory phonetics is the subfield that studies how the anatomy of the vocal apparatus is used to articulate speech. It addresses the biomechanics of positioning structures, the physics of airflow and the acoustics of the articulation.</para>

A coarser transcription is called a broad transcription. The English word little, for example, may be transcribed broadly using the IPA as [ˈlɪtəl], and this broad (imprecise) transcription is a more or less accurate description of many pronunciations.

        <title>Vowels</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm325674560">Vowels are mostly made distinguishable by differences in the distribution of energy among their harmonics. As vowels are produced with the vocal tract open, these differences are mostly generated through appropriate positioning of the elements in the vocal tract. This alters the resonance in the vocal cavities which in turn modifies the distribution of energy among the harmonics. The acoustics of vowels can be visualized using spectrograms, which display the acoustic energy at each frequency, and how this changes with time.</para>

A singer can vocalize an “ah” and change the fundamental frequency of the voice drastically while still holding a sound that can clearly be recognized as the vowel “ah”. Conversely, the singer can maintain the tension at the vocal folds constant while cycling through all the vowels. </para>

When the tension in the vocal folds is changed without moving the vocal tract, the formants stay the same, but the fundamental frequency changes. This results in a different set of harmonics being matched by the formants and emphasized by resonance in the vocal tract.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1055623920">One important aspect of vowel production is that the muscle contractions that produce the various vowels all occur along continual ranges without categorical steps. A person’s concept of a given vowel is a learned convention that is employed when producing the vowel and when recognizing it in another person’s speech. These conventions do not hold across languages and they also vary among regions that speak a same language. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1213447408">Formant charts are frequently used to analyze the continuum of the vowel space and study accents, dialects, pathologies and the boundaries between vowels. The first formant, abbreviated “F1", corresponds to vowel openness (vowel height). <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_vowel">Open vowels</link> have high F1 frequencies, while <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_vowel">close vowels</link> have low F1 frequencies, as can be seen in the accompanying spectrogram. The [i] and [u] have similar low first formants, whereas [ɑ] has a higher formant.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm865377264">The second formant, F2, corresponds to vowel frontness. <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_vowel">Back vowels</link> have low F2 frequencies, while <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_vowel">front vowels</link> have high F2 frequencies. This is very clear in the spectrogram, where the front vowel [i] has a much higher F2 frequency than the other two vowels. However, in open vowels, the high F1 frequency forces a rise in the F2 frequency as well, so an alternative measure of frontness is the difference between the first and second formants. For this reason, some people prefer to plot as F1 vs. F2 – F1. </para>

            <item>Bilabial. Produced with both lips. Ex: b, m, and p.</item>
            <item>Labiodental. f and v are articulated by placing the upper teeth against the lower lip.</item>
            <item>Interdental. "th"  as in think or as in the are pronounced by inserting the tip of the tongue between the teeth.</item>
            <item>Alveolar. t, d, n, s, z, l, and r are produced with the tongue is raised towards the alveolar ridge. The tip of the tongue may touch the ridge (t, d, n), or the tip may be lowered so that air escapes over it (s, z). For l, the middle of the tongue is raised while air escapes around  its sides. For r, the tip of tongue is curled back behind the alveolar ridge, or bunched up behind the ridge and the air escapes through the central part of the mouth.</item>
            <item>Palatal. j is produced by raising the front part of the tongue to the palate.</item>
            <item>Velar. k and g  are produced by raising the back of the tongue to the soft palate or the soft palate.</item>
            <item>Uvular. Some sounds are produced by raising the back of the tongue to the uvula. The 'r' in French and German may be an uvular trill. These do not normally occur in English.</item>
            <item>Glottal. h results from the flow of air coming from an open glottis, past the tongue and lips as they prepare to pronounce the vowel that follows h. </item>
