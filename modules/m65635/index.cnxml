  <md:title>Working with the Mouth+ENT</md:title>
  <md:abstract>The structures of the mouth+ENT are the focus of many professions, dealing with biology and health in animals and humans. They are also part of the job in many other professions because these structures are present in some many aspects of our daily lives.</md:abstract>

      <title>Professions of the Mouth and ENT</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm241827136">The mouth and ENT are  not the subject of a single profession. Many professionals with various backgrounds and interests deal with aspects of oral biology. It is important for them not to work in isolation but to learn about all the main aspects of oral biology. Several challenges in oral biology present multidisciplinary problems that take discussion and collaboration among professionals in multiple fields to produce appropriate solutions. Some of the main professions that deal with the mouth are:</para>

        <title>Paleontologist and archeologist, biologist</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm556038608">Paleontologists study life that existed prior to, and sometimes including, the start of the <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene"><emphasis effect="underline">Holocene</emphasis></link> Epoch (roughly 11,700 years <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_present"><emphasis effect="underline">before present</emphasis></link>). They mostly rely on fossils to determine an organism's <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"><emphasis effect="underline">evolution</emphasis></link> and interactions with other organisms and their environments (their <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoecology"><emphasis effect="underline">paleoecology</emphasis></link>). Vertebrates have evolved powerful biting which requires highly compact structures for teeth, jaws and other parts of the skull associated with mastication. These structures not only fossilize well but they reveal several aspects of the feeding ecology of the animal. Oral biology therefore makes a disproportionately large part of the material studied in paleontology. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm649868288">Archeology is the study of <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"><emphasis effect="underline">human</emphasis></link> activity through the recovery and analysis of material remains, including human fossils, food remains, the ruins of buildings, and human artifacts—items such as tools, pottery, and jewelry. As described above, remains of jaws and teeth provide rich material for recovery of the human past, including information on age, diet and health condition of the subject.</para>

Several branches of biology focus on the mouth. Questions about the evolution of the mouth are answered through comparative analysis, phylogenetic analysis and experimentation. As an example, a series of studies have shown how Darwin's finches (subfamily Geospizinae) have colonized the <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galápagos_Islands"><emphasis effect="underline">Galápagos Islands</emphasis></link> and diversified into various species with different beak morphologies. These endemic species occupy different dietary niches, specializing on different seed sizes and textures that have driven the divergent evolution of their beak morphologies. Other branches of biology conduct most of the non-clinical medical research associated with the mouth. This includes the study of genetic and developmental issues, infections, occupational issues, autoimmune diseases and cancer.</para>

        <title>Health professionals</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm252030368">Clinical practice and research on heath issues affecting the mouth and ENT is also conducted by various professionals. Dentists deal not only with teeth, but also with gum disease, and issues of the  temporomandibular joint. Otorhynolaringologists focus on conditions of the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) and related structures of the head and neck. Both professionals can specialize in maxillofacial surgery.</para>

        <title>Other professions</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm646308144">Many other professions exist that provide direct support to the services described above. And many other professions not directly related to the ones listed above can also have jobs dedicated to the mouth+ENT. These could include, for example, graphical design, marketing or biochemistry. Oral+ENT biology is a subject that permeates our physiology, behavior, culture, and economy, and therefore is naturally present in a great variety of occupations.</para>
