  <md:title>Variation in Dental Development</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Developmental variation in tooth number is not uncommon. One or a few missing teeth is common, with the third molars being the most commonly missing teeth. Extranumerary teeth are less common and normally involve a single tooth between the central incisors or around the maxillary molars. An entire set of teeth can be missing in rare conditions that impair ectodermal differentiation. Teeth that fail to erupt may be harmless, may contract caries or may compromise erupted teeth. In the later cases, management most likely includes their extraction.</md:abstract>

      <title>Tooth Number</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1414767024">Most vertebrates have dozens of teeth and some variation is usually found around the most common number of teeth within each species. Most humans, for example, have 20 teeth in the primary dentition and 32 in the permanent dentition. One or more <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_molar"><emphasis effect="underline">third molars</emphasis></link> are absent in 20–23% of the population, followed in prevalence by missing <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_premolar"><emphasis effect="underline">second premolar</emphasis></link><emphasis effect="underline">s</emphasis> and <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_incisor"><emphasis effect="underline">lateral incisor</emphasis></link><emphasis effect="underline">s</emphasis>. Without considering the third molars, about  3.5–8.0% of humans lack some other tooth. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm848001856">The condition of naturally having fewer teeth than the most common number in a species is called <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodontia">hypodontia</link>. The condition mostly results from developmental abnormalities with genetic origin. Selective Tooth Agenesis ("STHAG") has been associated with the genes <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX1">MSX1</link>, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAX9">PAX9</link>, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTBP3">LTBP3</link> and several others associated with the differentiation of the ectoderm. When identical twins lack a tooth, it tends not to be the same one. This indicates that environmental factors, in addition to genetic ones, are involved in the patterning of hypodontia. Common environmental factors include infection, trauma and some drugs. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1437520064">If many (more than five) teeth are missing the condition is called partial anodontia or oligodontia. Anodontia is the complete absence of primary or permanent teeth. It generally has a genetic basis and involves congenital obstruction of the development of the dental lamina. Partial or complete anodontia frequently accompany major genetic syndromes (ectodermal dysplasia, Down syndrome, Riegar syndrome), particularly those that affect ectodermal development.</para>

They can appear in any area of the dental arch and they are most common in the permanent maxillary arch.

It is more frequent in men than in women. A single extra tooth is most common (86% of cases) and it is most commonly found among the maxillary incisors. Many supernumerary teeth never erupt and not cause any complication. They may, however, delay eruption of nearby teeth or cause other problems which might require their extraction. Dental X-rays are often used to diagnose hyperdontia. </para>
