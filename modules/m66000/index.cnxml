    <para id="import-auto-idm195210832">The lips control the entrance into the mouth. They are positioned by an elaborate musculature and in many animals the lips can manipulate food items extensively before ingestion. The lips have one of the highest concentrations of touch and temperature receptors in the body and they can probe the physical characteristics of potential food items. The development of the lips is modified by sex hormones and they are a target of sexual selection. During kissing behavior, the lips are a central structure of interaction between individuals.</para>

      <para id="import-auto-idm458990832">The upper and lower lips form the border between the mouth and the exterior environment. The juncture where the lips meet the surrounding facial skin is the <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermilion_border"><emphasis effect="underline">vermilion border</emphasis></link>, and the typically reddish area within the borders is called the vermilion zone.
