  <md:title>Dental Plaque</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Saliva contains glycoproteins that form a protective pellicle on the crown of each tooth. Microorganisms in saliva bind the the pellicle and form a biofilm called plaque. Most of them ferment carbohydrates in the mouth and form lactic acid. Which can demineralize the enamel. They also secrete proteolytic enzymes that cause periodontal disease. The pellicle with plaque is mechanically removed during brushing and flossing. If proper cleaning is not done, multiple layers of plaque accumulate and make it more difficult to remove. It later mineralizes forming calculus which has to be removed with scalers at the clinic.</md:abstract>

      <title>The oral environment</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm161766304">Our teeth are moistened with saliva produced by various salivary glands in the mouth. Healthy saliva has a neutral pH and and electrolyte composition that resembles that of plasma with an increased abundance of phosphate and a few other ions. It also contains larger molecules that form mucus, enzymes, antimicrobials and other substances. Among those, some glycoproteins can bind to the exposed surface of enamel. They form a protective film, called dental pellicle, attached to the crown of each tooth. The pellicle is removed with tooth brushing but it forms again moments after the clean tooth makes contact with saliva.  </para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1697224320">Human saliva is also populated by microorganisms, including dozens of species of bacteria, fungi and archea. Most of them ferment dietary sugars and produce lactic acid. They can bind to the glycoproteins of the pellicle and remain attached to the tooth.</para>

      <title>Plaque formation</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1624885520">When microorganisms grow attached to a surface, they may also secrete a sticky extracellular matrix that further stabilizes them in place. This forms a <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm">biofilm</link>, a thin layer  of microorganisms + extracellular matrix.

        <title>Environment</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1320197648">The warm and moist environment of the mouth and the presence of teeth, makes a good environment for growth and development of dental plaque. Teeth make great settlement surfaces for the biofilm. Unlike other parts of the body, tooth surfaces are firm and non shedding. The main ecological factors that contribute to plaque formation are <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH">pH</link>, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva">saliva</link>, temperature and availability of oxygen. The normal pH of saliva is neutral and plaque flourishes at pH 6.7 to 8.3. Variation in pH within the mouth favors the development of specific types of microorganisms in plaque. Saliva acts as a <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution">buffer</link> maintaining the pH in the mouth between 6 and 7. The normal temperature of the mouth ranges between 35 °C and 36 °C, and a two-degree change has been shown to drastically shift the dominant species in the plaque. Oxidizing reactions are carried out by <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_bacteria">aerobic bacteria</link>. Their metabolism influences the oxygen levels in plaque and affects the composition of its microbial community.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1557425488">The microorganisms in plaque are normally unable to harm the teeth.  They attach to the pellicle and grow at a moderate speed forming a thin plaque. The lactic acid that they secrete diffuses easily into the saliva where it is buffered and it does not affect the enamel which is protected by the pellicle. Most of the cover of pellicle and plaque is removed daily at each event of tooth brushing and flossing. Plaque is therefore present most of the time, but is it prevented from growing thick.</para>

      <title>Enamel demineralization and remineralization</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1363500624">The hydroxyapatite crystals Ca5(PO4)3(OH) in enamel are influenced by the pH at the pellicle and the concentrations of of Ca<sup>++</sup> and PO4<sup>---</sup> in saliva. Low pH stimulates dissolution of the hydroxyapatite crystals which leads to demineralization of the enamel. At high pH, calcium, phosphate and hydroxyl groups from saliva crystalize into hydroxyapatite, remineralizing the enamel. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1329891280">The teeth can be protected further by exposure to fluoride in saliva. Fluoride forms fluorapatite which is incorporated into the dental enamel. Fluoride reduces the rate of tooth enamel demineralization and increases the rate of remineralization of teeth. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm221182112">This dynamic balance between demineralization and remineralization of enamel allow teeth to recover from minor acidic attacks by plaque microorganisms. Failure to remove plaque by regular <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_brushing">tooth-brushing</link>, however, allows plaque to  proliferate unchecked.  With the build up in a thick layer, plaque can become difficult to remove and it can harm the tooth and the gingiva, causing various dental diseases.</para>

      <title>Plaque build-up and consequences</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1308456608">The first kind of plaque to form after the teeth are brush is supragingival biofilm, which is a dental plaque that forms above the gingiva. It is most common between the teeth, in the pits and grooves of the teeth and along the gums. It is rich in aerobic bacteria but if allowed to grow thick, anaerobic bacteria may dominate its composition.</para>

It follows the formation of the supragingival biofilm which grows along the dentogingival attachment line until it manages to bypass it. The subgingival biofilm is mostly made of anaerobic bacteria. As this plaque attaches in a pocket under the gums, it is less  exposed to oxygen. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1308889392"><link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis">Gingivitis</link> is the most common result of plaque build-up around the <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gums">gingival tissues</link> (see chapter 14 Gingiva). The bacteria found in the biofilm secrete acids and proteolytic enzymes that cause a localized inflammation of the tissue. This is characterized by a red, puffy appearance of the gums and bleeding during brushing or flossing. Gingivitis due to plaque can be resolved by removal of the plaque. If left for an extended period of time, however, the inflammation may begin to affect the periodontal ligament, in a progression referred to as <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis">periodontitis</link>. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1545642048">In periodontitis, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria">bacteria</link> in plaque release enzymes that attack not only the collagen but also the bone.
