  <md:title>The Biology of the Tongue</md:title>
  <md:abstract>The tetrapod tongue with mucosa and muscles originated in amphibians. It diversified greatly with key roles in food ingestion, gustation, swallowing and communication. The human tongue has four intrinsic and four extrinsic muscles, all innervated by the hyoglossal nerve. Its mucosa receives sensory innervation from four cranial muscles because it is formed with tissue contributions from four pharyngeal arches. Specializations of tongue structure and function are found in all classes of tetrapods, particularly among predator species.</md:abstract>

Cartilaginous and bony fishes have a “tongue” attached to the floor of the mouth but their structure does not contain muscle. Jawless fish like lampreys do have a muscular tongue. After they attach to the body of a host using their mouth as a suction cup with keratinous “teeth”, they use their tongue muscles to rasp their abrasive tongue against the scales and skin of the host to cause the oozing of the body fluids on which they feed. The tongue structure and associated muscles in the lampreys are not homologous (did not have the same origin) to those of the tongues of tetrapods. There is no evidence, therefore, that the tetrapod tongue would have appeared among fishes.</para>

The separation is made by a V-shaped groove called terminal sulcus. The apex of the terminal sulcus points posteriorly and it is marked by a blind foramen, the foramen cecum, which is the remnant of a duct to an embryonic sac (<link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_diverticulum">thyroid diverticulum</link>) that connected the tongue to the thyroid gland during  early <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryogenesis">embryonic development</link>. </para>

        <title>Mucosa</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1125065664">The dorsal surface of the tongue is formed by the masticatory oral mucosa.  It contains areolar connective tissue with a variety of lingual glands and a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium . Lingual glands in the connective tissue secrete saliva, mucus and a watery serous fluid that contains the enzyme lingual lipase, which plays a minor role in breaking down fat but does not begin working until it is activated in the stomach. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1149403616">The dorsal mucosa contains a high density of four types of lingual papillae. Filiform papillae cover most of the dorsal surface of the anterior 2/3 of the tongue, with fungiform interspaced. Filiform papillae are small, long, thin and lack taste buds. They have touch receptors are keratinized to create an abrasive surface on the tongue. Fungiform papillae are mushroom shaped with taste buds on their upper surface. Foliate papillae are four or five short vertical folds and are present on each side at the back of the tongue. They lack <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin">keratin</link> and bear many taste buds. Circumvallate papillae are dome-shaped. Humans have 8 to 12 aligned in a V-shape immediately anterior to the foramen cecum and sulcus terminalis. Each papilla consists of a projection of mucous membrane surrounded by a  circular depression. The wall of the projection is called (vallum), and the circular sulcus is called fossa. Numerous taste buds are found in the vallum. Ducts of lingual salivary glands, known as Von Ebner's glands, empty a serous secretion into the fossa. </para>

      <title>Gustation</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1135648432">Gustation is the special sense associated with the tongue. Within the structure of the papillae are taste buds that contain specialized gustatory receptor cells for the transduction of taste stimuli. The taste buds of the lingual papillae are round epithelial structures containing basal (stem) cells, gustatory receptor cells and supporting cells. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm297423552">The gustatory receptor cells are sensitive to the chemicals contained within foods that are ingested, and they release neurotransmitters based on the amount of the chemical in the food. Neurotransmitters from the gustatory cells can activate sensory neurons in the facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus cranial nerves.</para>

      <caption>The tongue and its four types of lingual papillae, three of which containing taste buds, which in turn house the gustatory receptor cells. Chemicals in food bind to membrane receptors in the gustatory receptors cells, which then send neural stimuli to the brain.  <link url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/1402_The_Tongue.jpg">More details</link>.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-idm291298624">Salty taste is simply the perception of sodium ions (Na+) in the saliva. When you eat something salty, the salt crystals dissociate into the component ions Na+ and Cl–, which dissolve into the saliva in your mouth. The Na+ concentration becomes high outside the gustatory cells, creating a strong concentration gradient that drives the diffusion of the ion into the cells. The entry of Na+ into these cells results in the depolarization of the cell membrane and the generation of a receptor potential.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm922741216">Sour taste is the perception of H+ concentration. Just as with sodium ions in salty flavors, these hydrogen ions enter the cell and trigger depolarization. Sour flavors are, essentially, the perception of acids in our food. Increasing hydrogen ion concentrations in the saliva (lowering saliva pH) triggers progressively stronger graded potentials in the gustatory cells. For example, orange juice—which contains citric acid—will taste sour because it has a pH value of approximately 3. Of course, it is often sweetened so that the sour taste is masked.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1135782672">The first two tastes (salty and sour) are triggered by the cations Na+ and H+. The other tastes result from food molecules binding to a G protein–coupled receptor. A G protein signal transduction system ultimately leads to depolarization of the gustatory cell. The sweet taste is the sensitivity of gustatory cells to the presence of glucose dissolved in the saliva. Other monosaccharides such as fructose, or artificial sweeteners such as aspartame (NutraSweet™), saccharine, or sucralose (Splenda™) also activate the sweet receptors. The affinity for each of these molecules varies, and some will taste sweeter than glucose because they bind to the G protein–coupled receptor differently.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm301906640">Bitter taste is similar to sweet in that food molecules bind to G protein–coupled receptors. However, there are a number of different ways in which this can happen because there are a large diversity of bitter-tasting molecules. Some bitter molecules depolarize gustatory cells, whereas others hyperpolarize gustatory cells. Likewise, some bitter molecules increase G protein activation within the gustatory cells, whereas other bitter molecules decrease G protein activation. The specific response depends on which molecule is binding to the receptor.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm937198576">One major group of bitter-tasting molecules are alkaloids. Alkaloids are nitrogen containing molecules that are commonly found in bitter-tasting plant products, such as coffee, hops (in beer), tannins (in wine), tea, and aspirin. By containing toxic alkaloids, the plant is less susceptible to microbe infection and less attractive to herbivores. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1282274480">Therefore, the function of bitter taste may primarily be related to stimulating the gag reflex to avoid ingesting poisons. Because of this, many bitter foods that are normally ingested are often combined with a sweet component to make them more palatable (cream and sugar in coffee, for example). The highest concentration of bitter receptors appear to be in the posterior tongue, where a gag reflex could still spit out poisonous food.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm308206752">The taste known as umami is often referred to as the savory taste. Like sweet and bitter, it is based on the activation of G protein–coupled receptors by a specific molecule. The molecule that activates this receptor is the amino acid L-glutamate. Therefore, the umami flavor is often perceived while eating protein-rich foods. Not surprisingly, dishes that contain meat are often described as savory.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm308206176">Once the gustatory cells are activated by the taste molecules, they release neurotransmitters onto the dendrites of sensory neurons. These neurons are part of the facial and glossopharyngeal cranial nerves, as well as a component within the vagus nerve dedicated to the gag reflex. The facial nerve connects to taste buds in the anterior third of the tongue. The glossopharyngeal nerve connects to taste buds in the posterior two thirds of the tongue. The vagus nerve connects to taste buds in the extreme posterior of the tongue, verging on the pharynx, which are more sensitive to noxious stimuli such as bitterness.</para>

Along its length it is covered in backward-curving <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_bud">papillae</link> and coated in thick, sticky saliva secreted from large salivary glands. This allows the giant anteater to collect insects by extending the tongue into ant or termite mounds. During feeding, the tongue moves in and out around 160 times per minute and the anteater swallows at a higher rate than most other mammals. </para>

        <title>Woodpeckers</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1146169776">Woodpeckers feed mainly on insects and their grubs taken from living and dead trees, and other arthropods, along with fruit, nuts and sap from live trees. The family is noted for its ability to acquire wood-boring grubs using the bill for hammering. The insect prey most commonly taken are those found inside tree trunks and in crevices in the bark. These include <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle"><emphasis effect="underline">beetles</emphasis></link> and their grubs, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant"><emphasis effect="underline">ants</emphasis></link>, termites, spiders, and caterpillars. They may be obtained either by gleaning or, more famously, by excavating wood. Having hammered a hole into the wood, the prey is impaled by a long tongue that is pointy and barbed near the tip. The long tongue is then retracted into the mouth. The muscle slides over the hyoid cartilage which has posterior horns that can extend around the brain to attach to the superior base of the beak. This allows room to fit the entire retracted tongue into the mouth. </para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm937391536">The chameleon has a catapult system that allows it to launch the tongue up to 1.5 body lengths away to catch prey. Tongue projection occurs extremely quickly, reaching the prey in as little as 0.07 seconds with an accelerations that exceed 40 gravities. The <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"><emphasis effect="underline">power</emphasis></link> with which the tongue is launched (~3000 W kg−1) exceeds the physiological limit of muscles, indicating the presence of an amplification system. The muscle therefore loads an elastic system that launches the tongue when triggered.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1075848704">This system is formed by a highly modified <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoid"><emphasis effect="underline">hyoid bone</emphasis></link>, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscles_of_tongue"><emphasis effect="underline">tongue muscles</emphasis></link>, and a collagenous sheath. The hyoid bone has an elongated projection, called the entoglossal process. A cylindric sheath of collagen covers the entoglossal process and connects it to the surrounding accelerator muscle. This muscle is also cylindric and its fibers are arranged radially. When the accelerator muscle contracts around the entoglossal process, it becomes thinner and has to expand longitudinally along the length of the bone because muscle tissue is not compressible. This longitudinal expansion stretches the collagenous sheath longitudinaly, storing a large amount of energy that will produce the work when the tongue is launched. Continued contraction of the accelerator muscle triggers the system. The entoglossal process end abruptly at its anterior end. When the accelerator muscle expands longitudinally it slides over the entoglossal process until some of it slides off the tip. This produces and anterior anchorage that allows the collagen sheath to release the stored energy like a stretched rubber band, launching itselft and the accelerator muscle anteriorly. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm299174160">If the target is hit, the prey is usually captured in the sticky pad that covers the anterior end of the tongue. A retractor muscle, the hyoglossus, connects the accelerator muscle to the hyoid and is responsible for drawing the tongue back into the mouth.</para>
