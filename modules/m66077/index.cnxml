  <md:title>Dental Position and Structure</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Humans have a succedaneous dentition in which a set of primary teeth is replaced once by a set of permanent teeth. All teeth are classified as incisor, canine, premolar or molar. For dental notation, quadrants are numbered clockwise starting with the upper right. Teeth are numbered sequentially or medio-distally depending on the notation system in use. Positional terms and surface landmarks are used to refer to specific locations on each tooth. Human teeth have a live dental pulp surrounded by dentin and covered by enamel at the crown and by cementum at the root. It is irrigated by the maxillary artery and innervated by the trigeminal nerve, with sensory receptors for pain, vibration and temperature.</md:abstract>

    <para id="import-auto-idm1162766176">Humans are born without teeth. A primary dentition is formed by age 6, then the milk teeth are gradually replaced by permanent teeth in a process that completes itself around age 12. Additional teeth erupt up to age 20 when the full permanent dentition is completed. In this chapter we will examine the morphology and development of human teeth. </para>

There are first and second premolars, and first, second, and third molars. The side of the mouth in which a tooth is found may also be included in the name. For example, a specific name for a tooth may be "permanent maxillary left lateral incisor."</para>

It uses two-digits to identify teeth. The first digit represents a tooth's quadrant and the second digit represents the number of the tooth from the midline of the face. For permanent teeth, the upper right teeth begin with the number 1. The upper left teeth begin with the number 2. The lower left teeth begin with the number 3. The lower right teeth begin with the number 4. For primary teeth, the sequence of first digits is 5, 6, 7, and 8, respectively. When speaking about a certain tooth such as the permanent maxillary central incisor, the notation is pronounced “one-one” instead of “eleven”.</para>

Triangular ridges are those that project from the cusp tips of premolar and molars to the central groove. Transverse ridges are formed by the union of two triangular ridges on posterior teeth. The joining of buccal and lingual triangular ridges is usually named as an example. The oblique ridge is found on the occlusal surfaces of maxillary molars.

The root lacks enamel and is instead covered by a thin layer of a hard tissue called cementum. Dentin composes most of the root forming root canals that contain pulp tissue. A tooth can have a single or multiple roots. The tooth is supported at the root by an attachment apparatus called periodontium.

It is normally visible and it is supported by underlying dentin. The composition of enamel is mostly mineral (96%), with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. Enamel is semitranslucent, therefore the color of dentin and any restorative dental material deep to the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusp_(dentistry)"><emphasis effect="underline">cusp</emphasis></link>, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border at the neck of the tooth. </para>

This porous, yellow-hued material is made up of 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight.

Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border. The diameter of these tubules ranges from 2.5 μm near the pulp, to 1.2 μm in the midportion, and 900 nm near the dentino-enamel junction. Although they may have tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other. Their length is dictated by the radius of the tooth.  Although the dentin is acellular, the dentinal tubules allow odontoblasts in the pulp cavity to maintain the mineral composition of the dentin through long cytoplasmatic extensions.</para>

          <title>Pain</title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1096038224">The most abundant sensory receptors in a tooth are nociceptors, a class of receptors specialized in conveying pain stimuli. The dental nociceptors are classified as A-fibers or C-fibers. A sharp pain is typically originated at A-fibers reacting to cold or mechanical stimuli, such as cold drinks or toothbrushing. C-fibers are usually involved in long-lasting dull pain produced by inflammation of the pulp. A-fibers tend to be thick and myelinated,  which are neuronal traits associated with fast stimulus conduction. C-fibers are usually thin and non-myelinated.</para>

          <title>Mechanical stimuli</title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm228255616">Mechanoreception inside the teeth seems to be based on responses of odontoblasts in the pulp. When the enamel cover of the tooth is removed or damaged, the peripheral end of the dentinal tubules may be opened, and stimuli in the surrounding medium may produce fluid displacement in the tubules. Stretch-activated potassium channels on the cellular membrane of the odontoblasts are activated, leading the cell to release chemicals that activate adjacent nociceptors.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm228255360">Outside the tooth, mechanoreceptors are present on the periodontal ligaments. These are collaginous fibers that anchor the root of the tooth to the surrounding alveolar bone. A type of stretch receptor called Ruffini receptor is found on the periodontal ligaments. It has finger-like projections which extend into the surrounding tissue to detect the deformation of collagen fibers. Its role is to respond to accidental movement of the tooth in its socket, such as when you bite into a hard object in your food, and activate a nociceptive reflex that causes immediate relaxation of the muscles of mastication.</para>

          <title>Temperature</title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1064199296">In addition to acting as mechanoreceptors, the odontoblasts of the pulp can also respond to changes in temperature. Like the thermoreceptors in our skin, odontoblasts have transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels on their membranes. Many types of TRPs have been described, and each one opens at a certain temperature range. This allows odontoblasts to respond to cold or hot stimulation of the tooth (especially if the enamel cover is removed) and convey the stimulus to the surrounding sensory neurons (nociceptors).</para>

        <title>Reflexes</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1051222432">The stimuli transduced by the sensory receptors of the teeth, together with stimuli originating in stretch receptors within the muscles of mastication, are transmitted to the CNS by the trigeminal nerve. They are processed in the spinal trigeminal nucleus at the medulla oblongata. The reticular formation then transmits them to the thalamus, from where they are conveyed to the primary sensory cortex, allowing us to become aware of the sensation in the tooth.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1051222176">Our neural system also uses these stimuli to direct immediate reflex responses that do not require our awareness. One class of reflexes involves the use of feedback from the muscle spindles (stretch detectors) in the muscles of mastication to detect the position of the mandible and adjust the contraction of each muscle for stable and effective chewing. This myotatic response goes beyond simply stimulating the muscle when it is stretched. The response is dependent on chewing task, phase of movement, and site of stimulation.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1021674416">Another type of reflex is triggered by Ruffini receptors in the periodontal ligaments, which signal traumatic displacement of a tooth. When activated, this reflex causes immediate relaxation of the main muscles of mastication. This is thought to be a protective response designed to prevent tooth damage by further biting into a hard object.</para>
