  <md:title>The Salivary Glands</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Saliva has many important roles such as lubricating the mouth, hydrating, lubricating and digesting the food before swallowing, washing away and digesting food particles from the teeth and supporting some remineralization of the enamel. Saliva is produced by major and minor salivary glands. The major glands are the parotid, submandibular and sublingual salivary glands. Minor salivary glands are very small but very numerous and distributed over the entire oral mucosa. Salivary glands vary in the composition of their product, ranging from highly serous to highly mucous. Saliva has some special uses in animals, forming the venom of vipers, being used as glue for nest building by swifts or as a defense by camels.</md:abstract>

      <para id="import-auto-idm441671280">In the absence of food, parasympathetic stimulation keeps saliva flowing at appropriate  levels for speech, swallowing, rest and sleep. Salivation increases when  you smell, see, taste or think about food, even if you do not eat it. Drooling is an extreme instance of overproduction of saliva. During times of stress, such as before speaking in public, sympathetic stimulation takes over inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation thus  reducing salivation. This results in the symptom of dry mouth that we associate with anxiety. If you dehydrate, salivation is reduced causing the mouth to feel dry and prompting you to drink water.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm331487792">While you are eating, food chemicals stimulate taste receptors on the tongue. These send neural signals  to the superior and inferior salivatory nuclei in the brain stem. These two nuclei then send back parasympathetic stimuli through the glossopharyngeal and facial nerves to stimulate salivation. Even after you swallow food, salivation is increased to cleanse the mouth and to water down and neutralize any irritating chemical remnants, such as that hot sauce in your burrito. Most saliva is swallowed along with food and is reabsorbed, so that fluid is not lost.</para>

      <title>Composition of saliva</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm340605088">Saliva is essentially (98 to 99.5 percent) water. The remaining 4.5 percent is a complex mixture of ions, glycoproteins, enzymes, growth factors, and waste products. The most important ingredient in saliva is likely the enzyme salivary amylase for initiating the breakdown of carbohydrates. Food does not spend enough time in the mouth to allow all the carbohydrates to break down, but pancreatic amylase can continue the job in the intestines. Bicarbonate and phosphate ions function as chemical buffers, maintaining saliva at pH 6.35 to 6.85. Salivary mucus helps lubricate food, facilitating movement in the mouth, bolus formation, and swallowing. Saliva contains immunoglobulin A, which prevents microbes from penetrating the epithelium, and lysozyme, which makes saliva antimicrobial. Saliva also contains epidermal growth factor (EGF), which maintains and renovates the epithelium of the digestive tube.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm517697824">Each of the major salivary glands secretes a unique formulation of saliva according to its cellular makeup. For example, the parotid glands secrete a watery solution that contains salivary amylase. The submandibular glands have cells similar to those of the parotid glands, as well as mucus-secreting cells. Their saliva also contains amylase but in a liquid thickened with mucus. The sublingual glands contain mostly mucous cells, and they secrete the thickest saliva with the least amount of salivary amylase.</para>

      <para id="import-auto-idm457549504">Lack of saliva increases the risk of dental caries. Saliva has antimicrobial agents as well as ions that promote the remineralization of tooth enamel. Conditions that cause salivary gland hypofunction as well as conditions that lead the patient to sleep with the mouth open tend to be correlated with increased occurrence of cavities.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm332342768">Mumps is a viral infection of the nasal passages and pharynx by the paramyxovirus and it most commonly attacks the  parotid glands. Enlargement and inflammation of the parotid glands is typical, causing a characteristic swelling between the ears and the jaw. Symptoms include fever and throat pain, which can be severe when swallowing acidic substances such as orange juice. Mumps vaccines have greatly reduced the incidence of mumps, however. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 11 cases were reported in the US in 2011.</para>
