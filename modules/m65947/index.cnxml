  <md:title>Adaptations for Ingestion</md:title>
  <md:abstract>A wide diversity of facial adaptations that facilitate food ingestion can be found in animals. Examples include trunks, beaks, tentacles, whiskers, cheek pouches, suction cups, keratin denticles, and a baleen. These structures vary with phylogenetic history but also with prey type and feeding behavior.</md:abstract>

      <title>Diversity</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm488797552">Animals have evolved a great variety of mouth shapes and sizes in response to the selective pressures associated with feeding. The first fishes had mouths, but bony jaws evolved later and allowed for an impressive diversification in the group. Fishes, amphibians, reptiles and mammals have bony jaws and hard teeth for powerful biting, piercing and grinding. Birds, on the other hand, evolved much lighter keratinized beaks that facilitate flight. Outstandingly long mouths and tongues can be found in nectar feeders and anteaters. Strong beaks and skulls are present in woodpeckers that hit tree trunks with the beak to find insect larvae for food. Some examples of structural adaptations for feeding are presented below.</para>

        <title>Trunk</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm622467392">The trunk, or <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscis"><emphasis effect="underline">proboscis</emphasis></link>, is a fusion of the nose and upper lip, although in early <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"><emphasis effect="underline">fetal</emphasis></link> life, the upper lip and trunk are separated. The trunk is elongated and specialised to become the elephant's most important and versatile appendage. It contains up to 150,000 separate <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_fascicle"><emphasis effect="underline">muscle fascicles</emphasis></link>, with no bone and little fat. These paired muscles consist of two major types: superficial (surface) and internal. The former are divided into <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsoventral"><emphasis effect="underline">dorsals, ventrals</emphasis></link>, and <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_and_medial"><emphasis effect="underline">laterals</emphasis></link> while the latter are divided into <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_plane"><emphasis effect="underline">transverse</emphasis></link> and <link url="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/radiate"><emphasis effect="underline">radiating</emphasis></link> muscles. The muscles of the trunk connect to a bony opening in the skull. The trunk encloses two air passages that run side by side and are separated by a <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_septum"><emphasis effect="underline">nasal septum</emphasis></link> composed of tiny muscle units that stretch horizontally between the nostrils. A unique proboscis nerve, formed by the <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_nerve"><emphasis effect="underline">maxillary</emphasis></link> and <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"><emphasis effect="underline">facial nerves</emphasis></link>, runs along both sides of the trunk. It controls the muscles to produce lateral flexion, ventral flexion and extension of the trunk, the dilation of its walls for sucking in water, the compression of its walls, to expel the water into the mouth and a pinching movement at the tip of the trunk, which allows the animal to manipulate small objects precisely.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm722557888">Elephant trunks have multiple functions in addition to bringing food to the mouth. These include breathing, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction"><emphasis effect="underline">olfaction</emphasis></link>, touching, grasping, and sound production. The trunk's ability to make powerful twisting and coiling movements allows it to collect food, wrestle with other elephants, and lift up to 350 kg. The trunk can be used for delicate tasks, such as wiping an eye and checking an orifice, and it is capable of cracking a peanut shell without breaking the seed. An elephant can reach items at heights of up to 7 m with its trunk and dig for water under mud or sand. Elephants can suck up water both to drink and to spray on their bodies. An adult Asian elephant is capable of holding 8.5 liters of water in its trunk. When swimming, the elephant uses its trunk as a <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_snorkel"><emphasis effect="underline">snorkel</emphasis></link>.

        <para id="import-auto-idm243874992">Although beaks vary significantly in size, shape, color and texture, they share a similar underlying structure. Two bony projections—the upper and lower mandibles—are covered with a thin keratinized layer of epidermis known as the rhamphotheca. In most species, two holes known as nares lead to the respiratory system. In contrast with mammal jaws, the beaks of some birds (like seagulls) can articulate at multiple points instead of two. This allows them to widen the beak as they open it, and swallow a wider food item than would fit the width of the closed beak. This is specially useful for birds as they that lack teeth and most of them have to swallow food items whole.</para>

A classical example is the radiation of Darwin's finches in the Galapagos Islands (Fig. 8). A single species arrived to the islands from the continent and colonized them. It then gradually diversified into several species that specialized in the consumption of different seeds. The morphology of the beak evolved quickly to better exploit the food resource of each specialized new species.</para>

Secretions in the lamprey's mouth prevent the victim's blood from clotting. Victims typically die from excessive blood loss or infection.

        <title>Baleen</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm768983920">Baleen whales have evolved baleens which are series of parallel plates of calcified keratin attached to the upper jaw and used for filter feeding. The whale opens its mouth widely and scoops in dense <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling"><emphasis effect="underline">shoals</emphasis></link> of prey (such as <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill"><emphasis effect="underline">krill</emphasis></link>, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copepod"><emphasis effect="underline">copepods</emphasis></link>, small <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"><emphasis effect="underline">fish</emphasis></link> and sometimes <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"><emphasis effect="underline">birds</emphasis></link> that happen to be near the shoals), together with large volumes of water. It then partly shuts its mouth and presses its tongue against its upper jaw, forcing the water to pass out sideways through the baleen, thus sieving out the prey which it then swallows. This is a form of suction feeding and it allows the whale to capture multiple prey items at once. Whales are mammals and as such they were terrestrial animals before they moved into the sea. The availability of food as many small prey items is thought to have driven the loss of teeth and the evolution of suction feeding and baleen. The baleen is a keratinous structure that bears no resemblance with the structure of teeth. It has most likely evolved from the epithelium of the gums, in a similar way as to how the epithelium of the mammal skin produces nails, horns and hair, which are all made of keratin.</para>

        <title>Tongue</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm698140080">Many animals use the tongue as the primary way of taking food from the environment. Chameleons project a sticky tongue that adheres to the prey, whereas woodpeckers impale pray items with their barbed tongues. Giraffes have long and versatile tongues with which they harvest leaves from trees as they feed. The general structure of the tongue, specializations, and its role in gustation are discussed in the chapter Tongue and Gustation. </para>
