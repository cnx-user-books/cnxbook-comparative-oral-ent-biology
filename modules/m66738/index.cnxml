  <md:title>Caries</md:title>
  <md:abstract>The acid produced by bacteria in plaque through lactic fermentation causes gradual demineralization of the enamel. As it progresses deeper, the infection forms a cavity and the structural damage cannot be reversed anymore. Pain starts when the infection reaches the dentin. The pulp reacts making the dentin sclerotic at the site of the infection and this may stop the pain temporarily. The pulp also responds producing tertiary dentin. Infection of the pulp causes pulpitis and can produce intense pain. The infection can extend through the roots and form an abscess in the jaw bone.</md:abstract>

        <para id="import-auto-idm259447808">A person experiencing caries may initially not be aware of the disease. No pain is experienced and no reaction by the tooth is produced while only the enamel is being affected. The earliest sign of a new carious lesion is the appearance of an opaque white spot on the surface of the tooth, indicating an area of demineralization of enamel. This is referred to as a white spot lesion, an incipient carious lesion or a "microcavity". </para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm262608928">As the lesion continues to demineralize, it can turn brown but will eventually turn into a cavitation ("cavity"). Before the cavity forms, the process is reversible, but once a cavity forms, the lost tooth structure cannot be <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)">regenerated</link>. A lesion that appears dark brown and shiny suggests dental caries were once present but the demineralization process stopped, leaving a stain. Active decay is initially light in color and opaque in appearance.</para>

Some curvature is added to this orientation, however, around surface features such as groves, ridges and pits. Demineralization of enamel by caries tends to follow the direction of the enamel rods. Knowledge of the patterns of orientation of enamel rods in the tooth, therefore, allows the dentist to predict the shape of the caries and facilitates its treatment.</para>

        <title>Dentin</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm266200432">Once the infection reaches the dentin , it produces transient or constant pain which worsens upon exposure to heat, cold, or sweet foods and drinks. This is because the dentinal tubules, which extend into the pulp, transmit chemical and physical stimuli to the odontoblasts and pain receptors in the pulp. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm264297456">Unlike enamel, the <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin">dentin</link> reacts to the progression of dental caries. After <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_development">tooth formation</link>, the <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameloblast">ameloblasts</link>, which produce enamel, are destroyed once <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelogenesis">enamel formation</link> is complete and thus cannot later regenerate enamel after its destruction. On the other hand, dentin is <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentinogenesis">produced</link> continuously throughout life by <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontoblast">odontoblasts</link>, which reside at the border between the pulp and dentin. After the tooth erupts, the odontoblasts greatly decelerate the speed of dentin production, switching from manufacturing primary to secondary dentin. Caries stimulate the odontoblasts to intensify the production of dentin. These defense mechanisms include the formation of sclerotic and tertiary dentin.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm264033072">In dentin from the deepest layer to the enamel, the distinct areas affected by caries are the advancing front, the zone of bacterial penetration, and the zone of destruction. The advancing front represents a zone of demineralised dentin due to acid and has no bacteria present. The zones of bacterial penetration and destruction are the locations of invading bacteria and ultimately the decomposition of dentin. The zone of destruction has a more mixed bacterial population where proteolytic enzymes have destroyed the organic matrix. The innermost dentin caries has been reversibly attacked because the collagen matrix is not severely damaged, giving it potential for repair. The outer more superficial zone is highly infected with proteolytic degradation of the collagen matrix and as a result the dentin is irreversibly demineralized.</para>
        <section id="import-auto-idm249923296">
          <title>Sclerotic dentin</title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm264299680">Dentinal tubules radiate outward from the pulp chamber to the cementum or enamel border. The diameter of the dentinal tubules is largest near the pulp (about 2.5 μm) and smallest (about 900 nm) at the junction of dentin and enamel. The carious process expands through the dentinal tubules. This gives rise to  the triangular patterns shape of caries within dentin. </para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm243261856">In response to the caries, the fluid inside the tubules brings <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin">immunoglobulins</link> (antibodies) from the <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system">immune system</link> to fight the bacterial infection. At the same time, there is an increase of mineralization of the tubules. This results in a constriction of the tubules, which slows down the bacterial progression. In addition, as the acid from the bacteria demineralizes the hydroxyapatite crystals, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium">calcium</link> and <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus">phosphorus</link> are released, allowing for the precipitation of more crystals which fall deeper into the dentinal tubule. These crystals form a barrier and slow the advancement of caries. After these protective responses, the dentin is considered sclerotic.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm264077392">Since sclerotic dentin blocks the connection between the carious infection and the pulp pain that would otherwise serve as a warning of the invading bacteria may not develop. Consequently, dental caries may progress for a long period of time without any sensitivity of the tooth. Without pain, the caries may remain untreated for longer and result in   greater loss of tooth structure.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="import-auto-idm250031872">
          <title>Tertiary dentin</title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm250031488">As another response to dental caries, odontoblasts may intensify the production of new dentin (tertiary dentin) toward the pulp. This additional dentin is produced to protect the pulp for as long as possible from the advancing bacteria. As more tertiary dentin is produced, the size of the pulp decreases. This type of dentin has been subdivided according to the presence or absence of the original odontoblasts. If it is produced by the original odontoblasts that formed the tooth the dentin produced is called reactionary dentin. If new odontoblasts differentiate in the pulp to produced it the dentin is called reparative dentin.</para>

        <title>Pulp</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm264219440">When the caries reaches the pulp it causes inflammation of the pulpar tissue (<link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulpitis">pulpitis</link>). Since the pulp is surrounded by hard tissue, the swelling caused by the inflammatory response causes a pressure build up in the pulpar chamber. This exerts pressure on the nerves of the tooth and can lead to intense pain and throbbing. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm264259760">Pulpitis can also result from dental trauma or from exposure to heat. In such cases it can be reversible, but when caused by caries it almost always results in the death of tooth. The pressure build up and accompanying pain are relieved when the crown is opened (by the dentist or by the caries). If left untreated, the infection extends along the radicular pulp and passes through the apical foramina of the roots to enter the jaw bone. This forms an abscess (see chapter 15 Periodontal Disease). The abscess may form a fistula, a passage that extends from the abscess and opens at the surface of the gums or skin to relief the pressure and to drain the pus that is formed by the inflammation. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm249438784"> The infection can also expand from the abscess into other body tissues and become life-threatening. The tooth should be treated with root canal therapy, which involves removing all pulpar tissues, cleaning the pulp chamber and roots, filling them with a synthetic material and fitting a prosthetic crown to the tooth.</para>
