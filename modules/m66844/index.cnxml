  <md:title>Choking and Dysphagia</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Swallowing is the transport of food from the mouth into the stomach. The general mechanism is peristalsis of the digestive tube, but fishes can help it using mucociliary transport or pharyngeals jaws. Frogs add a muscular tongue and retraction of the eyes and some birds use gravity. Mammals have a palate and a muscular soft palate that protects the nasal cavity from the entrance of food. The epiglottis prevents food from entering the larynx. Its effectiveness is reduced in adult humans, however, because our larynx is permanently descended  and the epiglottis does not contact the soft palate. Imperfect swallowing results in chocking or pulmonary aspiration. The human larynx has most likely descended in response to selection for loud and low pitched voice. In newborns, the larynx is not yet descended however and they suckle by producing negative pressures in the mouth to extract milk from the nipple.</md:abstract>

      <title>Choking</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm429562832">Choking is a life-threatening medical emergency the passage of air passage into the <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung">lungs</link> is blocked by food or another object. This obstruction can be partial or complete. The disruption of normal breathing by choking hinders  <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen">oxygen</link> delivery to the body, resulting in <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia">asphyxia</link>. Although oxygen stored in the blood and lungs can keep a person alive for several minutes after breathing stops, chocking is potentially fatal. It is a major  cause of unintentional injury-related death.</para>

          <title>Basic Treatment</title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm182213392">For the conscious choking victim, most protocols recommend encouraging the victim to cough. If not effective, hard back slaps are attempted and if none of these procedures work, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_thrusts">abdominal thrusts</link> (Heimlich maneuver) or <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_thrusts">chest thrusts</link> are applied.

            <title>Back Blows (or Slaps)</title>
            <para id="import-auto-idm719367072">These are performed by leaning the choking victim forward, then delivering blows with the heel of the hand onto the victim's back, in between their shoulder blades.

            <para id="import-auto-idm834820560">Abdominal thrusts are usually recommended for their simplicity and effectiveness. They can be followed by chest thrusts, if abdominal thrusts are not effective. Abdominal thrusts are performed with the rescuer standing behind the person choking and exerting inward and upward pressure with their hands on the choking person's abdomen. The purpose of abdominal thrusts is to create pressure that will expel any object lodged in the airway upwards to relive the obstruction. The procedure is similar in chest thrusts, except that the pressure is applied around the chest. Chest trusts might be more effective on obese people.</para>

      <title>Dysphagia</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm484733792">Dysphagia is difficulty in swallowing. It can have various causes and involve different parts of the swallowing mechanism or anatomy. It frequently produces coughing,  chocking or <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration">pulmonary aspiration</link> (food or liquid going into the lungs) and subsequent <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia">aspiration pneumonia</link>. Dysphagia can also lead to <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration">dehydration</link> and weight loss.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm272261840">Oropharyngeal dysphagia includes difficulty controlling the position of food in the mouth, difficulty initiating a swallow, nasal regurgitation and gurgly voice after swallowing. Patients identify the mouth or neck as the site of the problem. These problems are common among older individuals, patients who have had strokes, head and neck cancer and progressive neurologic diseases like Parkinson's disease, <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia">d</link><link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia">ementia</link> or  <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis">m</link><link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis">ultiple sclerosis</link>.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm850461664">In esophageal dysphagia patients indicate an inability to swallow solid food, saying that it is held up before it reaches   the stomach or is regurgitated. Various diseases in or adjacent to the esophagus can result in dysphagia and the treatment will depend on the cause. <link url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achalasia">Achalasia</link> is an exception to usual pattern of dysphagia in that patients report more difficulty swallowing fluids than solids. It is caused by a degeneration of neural tissue in the  esophagus which results in peristaltic failure. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm684065424">The diagnosis of dysphagia commonly requires specialized techniques due to the concealed nature of the swallowing mechanism. Endoscopic techniques involve the lowering of a camera into the mouth, pharynx and esophagus and allow for imaging of the structure in action. Videofluoroscopy can also be useful, providing live x-ray images of the neck structures while the patient swallows a radio-opaque fluid.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm596951072">Many treatments are used in dysphagia because it is not a disease, but a symptom or condition associated with a wide variety of diseases. Treatments can include swallowing therapy, dietary changes, feeding tubes, certain medications, and surgery.</para>
