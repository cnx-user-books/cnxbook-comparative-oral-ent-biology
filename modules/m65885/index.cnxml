  <md:title>Formation of the Face</md:title>
  <md:abstract>The activation of controller genes coordinates the secretion of chemical signals that direct the differentiation of cells. A series of pharyngeal arches forms on each side of the pharynx and provides the precursors to most cranial and facial structures. The hard palate is formed through the early development of its medial anterior portion, followed by growth of the secondary portion from lateral to medial. Incomplete growth or fusion of the secondary portion results in cleft palate.</md:abstract>

Spemann and Mangold took dorsal cells from one embryo and transplanted them into the belly region of another embryo. They found that the transplanted embryo now had two notochords: one at the dorsal site from the original cells and another at the transplanted site. This suggested that the dorsal cells were genetically programmed to form the notochord and define the axis. Since then, researchers have identified many genes that are responsible for axis formation. Mutations in these genes leads to the loss of symmetry required for organism development.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm914679392">Animal bodies have externally visible symmetry. However, the internal organs are not symmetric. For example, the heart is on the left side and the liver on the right. The formation of the central left-right axis is an important process during development. This internal asymmetry is established very early during development and involves many genes. Research is still ongoing to fully understand the developmental implications of these genes.</para>
